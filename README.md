# ReCalendar Timeblock Edition

A fork of [ReCalendar.js](https://github.com/klimeryk/recalendar.js/) by [Igor Klimer](https://klimer.eu/) with added timeblock planner support.

**Live site:** https://1ndu5.github.io/recalendar.js/

**Original project:** https://recalendar.me/

## What's different in this fork?

All the features of the original ReCalendar are included. This fork adds:

- **Timeblock planner columns** - adds vertical lines to day pages, creating a time column, two scheduling columns, and a notes column. Column widths are fully configurable.
- **Shutdown checkbox** - adds configurable "Shut Down" text and a checkbox to the header of day pages. Can be enabled per day of the week (e.g. workdays only).

## Development
